# Interactive-Div-Cloning-Page
This repository presents a webpage with three div elements. Upon clicking any div, a copy of it appears at the end of the page. The original div becomes unclickable to prevent duplication. Ideal for exploring interactive DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
